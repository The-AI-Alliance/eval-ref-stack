# README

[Published Documentation](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/eval-ref-stack/)

This repo contains the code and documentation for the AI Alliance _Evaluation Reference Stack_, which is designed to provide an out-of-the-box suite of tools for running almost any kind of model and app _evaluations_, e.g., for safety, performance, alignment to use cases and requirements, etc.

See also the [Evaluation Is for Everyone](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) project and the [Testing Generative AI Applications](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ai-application-testing/) project, which use this reference stack.  

## About the Evaluation Reference Stack

The project is developed by the AI Alliance [Trust and Safety Work Group](https://thealliance.ai/focus-areas/trust-and-safety) project. The rationale for the project is to provide enterprise developers with an easy to use, full-featured stack for running evaluations. The core of the stack are de facto industry standard tools that are used by many experts to right published evaluations for trust and safety purposes. Note that we also plan to offer an optional integration of these tools with [Llama Stack](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a popular, full-featured AI application framework.

The [documentation](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/eval-ref-stack/) describes how to use the stack.
